# adsb_api_project
Code for my masters capstone project involving ads-b flight data.

My masters capstone project involves determining if ads-b flight data can be used as a proxy to assess the risk of landing accidents for certain GA aircraft. This would provide a real time assessment, and could allow intervention prior to accidents if high risk is observed.
